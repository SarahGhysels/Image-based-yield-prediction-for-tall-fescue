# Image-based yield prediction for tall fescue using random forests and convolutional neural networks
Repository containing all code used in the study 'Image-based yield prediction for tall fescue using random forests and convolutional neural networks'. 
- The Data preprocessing folder contains the codes used to clip the individual plants out of the orthomosaic, create the stratified train-test sets and redistribute the threshold classes of the train set into the breeder's classes. 
- The Data exploration folder details the code for each step in the data exploration section.
- The RF Models folder contains the three RF models: DMY, Top-performers and Breeder's score.
- The CNN models folder comprises of the three CNN models.
