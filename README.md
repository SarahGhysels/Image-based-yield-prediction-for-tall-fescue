# Estimation-of-individual-plant-performance-in-tall-fescue-through-RGB-image-analysis
Repository containing all supplemental material, code and data used in the study 'Estimation of individual plant performance in tall fescue through RGB image analysis'. 
- The Data preprocessing folder contains the codes used to clip the individual plants out of the orthomosaic, create the stratified train-test sets and redistribute the threshold classes of the train set into the breeder's classes. 
- The Data exploration folder details the code for each step in the data exploration section.
- The RF Models folder contains the three RF models: DMY, Top-performers and Breeder's score.
- The CNN models folder comprises of the three CNN models.
- The Data folder contains 'Multigras_data.csv' which comprises the dry matter yield measurements of each individual plant (column 'DMY (kgh/ha)'), the breeder's score ('Score MG') and the location of each plant in the field ('Blok_Rij_Plantnr').
